### Restlet Framework NG

This project is a prototype for the next generation of the Restlet Framework.

To build the Maven project, you need to get and build locally [this pull request](https://github.com/playframework/netty-reactive-streams/pull/17) from the Netty Reactive Streams project.

For background on this effort, see [this presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/jlouvel/restlet-framework-ng) at REST Fest 2016.

The current stable version 2 is available in [this other repository](https://github.com/restlet/restlet-framework-java).
